<p className="lead">Hello! I’m a NYC-based urbanist-technologist working across urban development, strategic design, and urban technologies.</p>

<h3>Purposeful urban technologies</h3>

<p>I have turned nascent urban technology concepts into designs, prototypes, real-world urban pilots, and products, with deep domain expertise in mobility, spatial data, and hybrid digital-physical systems. I’m particularly interested in how technologies are developed, deployed, and operationalized in a way that aligns with real-world purpose, systemic good, and human experience of place.</p>

<h3>Strategic design for cities</h3>

I have led complex urban development projects at the scale of districts and cities, exercising design leadership and managing complex teams and stakeholder relationships. With a singular focus on creating sustainable, inclusive, and economic vibrant cities, I draw on a diverse range of design capabilities–[urban design](http://www.siqizhu.net/seaport-planning/), [experience and service design](https://www.siqizhu.net/charlestown-navy-yard/), digital prototyping, [data visualization](https://www.siqizhu.net/data-vis-urbanism/) and [data science](https://www.siqizhu.net/go-boston-2030/)–that are part of a broader “strategic design” agenda for cities.

<h3>Critical interests</h3>

My professional work underpins my critical interests: how urban technologies and real estate development shape and are in turn shaped by the political economic regime of the contemporary city; the legibility and governance of emerging cyber-physical technology being deployed in urban space; technology controversies and technology counterfactuals; and evolving demands on the design professions to respond to these issues effectively.

I currently work at Sidewalk Labs (now a part of Google), where my role spans urban development planning, technology incubation, and program management. I also teach at Harvard’s [Master of Design Engineering program](https://mde.harvard.edu/), where I work with students to design and prototype speculative technologies for societal good. I continue to undertake speculative and applied research projects with collaborators.
