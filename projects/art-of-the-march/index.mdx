I have taught data visualization at Northeastern University’s IDV and Harvard University’s Masters in Design Engineering programs, and frequently take on speculative projects as well as exhibition work. 

I’m particularly interested in advancing data visualization’s discursive potential and its possibilities as a new “way of knowing”. My teaching and project work applies data visualization’s power to generate new knowledge, discourse, and activism towards new domains of interest (e.g. urbanism, political speech), with often surprisingly productive results.

<h4>Art of the March: Making Sense of Political Speech</h4>

This speculative project focuses on representing and analyzing political speech, specifically through the 6,000 hand-made signs collected at the Boston Women’s March in 2017. Working with Dietmar Offenhuber and a team of other researchers at Northeastern University, I developed a data visualization that facilitates the visual exploration of this large graphic archive, as well as the classification and clustering of embeddings.
