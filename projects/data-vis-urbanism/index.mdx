As faculty at Northeastern's IDV program, I introduced an urban agenda to the program's data visualization and design pedagogy, focusing on its potential as a new "way of knowing cities" and re-problematizing urban issues.

Students are challenged to use data visualization to generate new discourses and activism on issues such as spatial inequalities and the impact of tech platforms on cities.
