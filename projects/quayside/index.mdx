I was part of the Sidewalk Labs team that oversaw the development of the Quayside, a 12-acre, ~3 million SF urban development project in Toronto that demonstrated some of the most cutting-edge ideas in sustainable city-building.

My specific responsibility included overseeing the design of the projectâ€™s horizontal elements, including Parliament Plaza, Queens Quay, and the amphibious public spaces around Parliament Slip; and overseeing technology integration within these elements (which became part of the larger Quayside Digital Innovation Appendix).
