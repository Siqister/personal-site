I worked with a team at [MIT Civic Data Design Lab](https://civicdatadesignlab.mit.edu/NextStop) to create an analog and digital experience as part of [“The Road Ahead: Reimagining Mobility”](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/2318794479/) exhibit at Cooper Hewitt. I designed and built the digital centerpiece of the exhibit, visualizing the semantic content of the hundreds of visitor-submitted responses on their desired future urban mobility experience.
